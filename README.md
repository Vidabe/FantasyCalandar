## Intro
Create your own fantasycalendar for your DnD, SciFi or other projects. Define the number of months in a year, the number of days in each
month, the number of weekdays and name them as you like it! Define your own leap-years, create and add as many moons as you like and
add recurring and one-time dates as you see fit. 

## Requirements
An up-to-date LaTeX distribution.

## Usage
The files "fantasycalender.code.tex", "fantasycalenderbase.code.tex" and "fantasycalendermoon.code.tex" need to be in the same folder
as the .tex document you want to use them in. In the document itself you may use `\input{fantasycalender.code}` in the preamble to include it.

## Quick Start
There is a wiki for a quick start on (https://github.com/Vidabe/FantasyCalendar/wiki)

## Examples
There are many examples to look at, e.g. "DnD5e.tex", "Fantasy1.tex", "Greorgian.tex", "Klingon.tex", etc.
